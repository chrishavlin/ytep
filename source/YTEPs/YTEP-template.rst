YTEP-9999: YTEP Template
========================

To write a YTEP, copy this template to the next numerical number, add it to the
repository, and issue a pull request.  Discussion of the YTEP will occur either
on the mailing list (for large-scale changes) or in the PR itself (small items,
such as formatting).

This document has been patterned after the Matplotlib Enhancement Proposal
Template (found `here
<https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/wiki/MEPTemplate>`_.)

Detailed Description
--------------------

Here is where you should write detailed description of what the YTEP proposes.
This needs to include:

  * Background
  * Nature of the problem
  * Nature of the solution
  * How will the solution be implemented
    * Brief outline of the code needed to implement this
    * Code examples of using the solution, in appropriate
    * How will the solution be tested?
  * What are any stumbling points
  * What is the proposed method for reaching out to the community about this?

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

This section should outline backwards compatibility issues.  In particular, it
should focus on those issues that will appear to the main scripting API: will
this break old scripts?  Will it break internal uses of the API?

Alternatives
------------

*This section is optional.*

What other means are there to accomplishing the goals of this YTEP, and why is
this the best option?
